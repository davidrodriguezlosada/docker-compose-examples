# Docker compose examples
This project contains a bunch of Docker compose files that I regularly use to develop. Nothing special, just utilities.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
If you want to use any of these templates, you will have to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in your computer.

### Usage
You can run any file by using the regular docker-compose command:

    docker-compose -f <filename> up -d
